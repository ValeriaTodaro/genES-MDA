#Obs.txt contains the observation data and their locations and sampling times. The spatial location is given in terms of xyz coordinates. 
#It must be written as follows:
#1st column: x-coordinates
#2nd column: y-coordinates
#3rd column: z-coordinates
#4th column: sampling times
#5th column: observed data
#If spatial coordinates or sampling times are not available or observations are time/space independent, they must be replaced with NaN.
#m is the total number of observations
